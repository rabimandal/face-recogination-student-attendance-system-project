# Automatic Attendance System using face recognition and detection.

A python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance.

In this python project, I have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique. I have also intergrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.

TECHNOLOGY USED:

tkinter for whole GUI
OpenCV for taking images (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
Haar Cascade-Classifiers for face recognition
LBPH Library for Face Detection
MySQL for database (backend)
CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.
